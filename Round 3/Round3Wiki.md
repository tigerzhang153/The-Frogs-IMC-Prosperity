# Round 3 **- “Gloves Off”**

Welcome to Solvenar! A prosperous and highly developed planet known for technological innovation, a robust economy, and thriving cultural sectors.

This awe-inspiring society will be the stage for the ***Great Orbital Ascension Trials*** (GOAT). In this Great Galactic Trade-Off, you will face other trading crews head-on as you compete for the coveted title of Trading Champion of the Galaxy. This trading round marks the start of GOAT, where ***all teams begin with zero PnL and the leaderboard is reset***.

You will develop a new Python program and incorporate your strategy for trading ***Hydrogel Packs*** (`HYDROGEL_PACK`), ***Velvetfruit Extract*** (`VELVETFRUIT_EXTRACT`), and ***10 Velvetfruit Extract Vouchers*** (`VELVETFRUIT_EXTRACT_VOUCHER`). These vouchers give you the right to buy Velvetfruit Extract at a later point for a specific strike price.

To kick off GOAT, the Celestial Gardeners’ Guild is making a rare appearance, offering you the opportunity to buy ***Ornamental Bio-Pods*** from them. You may submit two offers and trade with as many of the so-called “Guardeners” as aligns with your strategy for maximum profitability. Secure those Bio-Pods, and they will be automatically converted into profit before the next trading round begins.

Be aware that ***trading rounds on Solvenar (Solvenarian days) last only 48 hours***. Be decisive, thorough, and fast, and make this first step toward the ultimate title count.

# **Round Objective**

Create a new Python program that algorithmically trades `HYDROGEL_PACK`, `VELVETFRUIT_EXTRACT`, and `VELVETFRUIT_EXTRACT_VOUCHER` on your behalf and generates your first profit in this final phase.

In addition, manually submit two orders to trade Ornamental Bio-Pods with members of the Celestial Gardeners’ Guild, then automatically sell your acquired Bio-Pods to generate additional profit.

# **Algorithmic trading challenge: “Options Require Decisions”**

There are 2 ‘asset classes’ in the three products you trade. The `HYDROGEL_PACK` and `VELVETFRUIT_EXTRACT` are “delta 1” products, similar to the products in the tutorial and rounds 1 and 2. The 10 `VELVETFRUIT_EXTRACT_VOUCHER` products (each with a different strike price) are options, and thus follow different dynamics. All products are traded independently, even though the price of `VELVETFRUIT_EXTRACT_VOUCHER` might be related to that of `VELVETFRUIT_EXTRACT` due to the nature of options.

The vouchers are labeled `VEV_4000`, `VEV_4500`, `VEV_5000`, `VEV_5100`, `VEV_5200`, `VEV_5300`, `VEV_5400`, `VEV_5500`, `VEV_6000`, `VEV_6500`, where VEV stands for **V**elvetfruit **E**xtract **V**oucher, and the number represents the strike price. They all have a 7-day expiration deadline starting from round 1, where each round represents 1 day. Thus, the ‘time till expiry’ (TTE) is 7 days in round 1 (TTE=7d), 6 days in round 2, 5 days in round 3, and so on.

The position limits ([see the Position Limits page for extra context and troubleshooting](https://imc-prosperity.notion.site/writing-an-algorithm-in-python#328e8453a09380cfb53edaa112e960a9)) are:

- `HYDROGEL_PACK`: 200
- `VELVETFRUIT_EXTRACT`: 200
- `VELVETFRUIT_EXTRACT_VOUCHER`: 300 for each of the 10 vouchers.

<aside>
📃

**Example**: `VEV_5000` is an option on the underlying VEV with a strike price of 5000 and a position limit of 300. At the start of the final simulation of Round 3, its time to expiry (TTE) is 5 days. In the historical data, the corresponding TTE values are:

- TTE=8d in historical day 0 (coinciding with the tutorial round),
- TTE=7d in historical day 1 (coinciding with Round 1),
- TTE=6d in historical day 2 (coinciding with Round 2).

# **Manual trading challenge: “The Celestial Gardeners’ Guild”**

You trade against a number of counterparties that all have a **reserve price** ranging between **670** and **920**. On the next trading day, you’re able to sell all the product for a fair price, **920**.

The distribution of the bids is **uniformly distributed** at **increments of 5** between **670** and **920**. 

<aside>
📃

**Example**: counterparties may have reserve prices at 675 and 680, but not at 676, 677, 678, 679, etc..

</aside>

You may submit **two bids**. If the first bid is **higher** than the reserve price, they trade with you at your first bid. If your second bid is **higher** than the reserve price of a counterparty and **higher** than the mean of second bids of all players you trade at your second bid. If your second bid is **higher** than the reserve price, but **lower** than the mean of second bids of all players, the chance of a trade rapidly decreases: you will trade at your second bid **but** your PNL is penalised by 

$$
\left(\frac{920 - \text{avg\_b2}}{920 - b2}\right)^3
$$

## **Submit your orders**

Submit your two bids directly in the Manual Challenge Overview window and click the “Submit” button. You can re-submit new bids until the end of the trading round. When the round ends, the last submitted bids will be offered to the members of the Celestial Gardeners' Guild.
